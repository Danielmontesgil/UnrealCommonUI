# UnrealCommonUI

This project is part of my ongoing journey to advance my skills in **Unreal Engine** and **C++**. While it starts with a
focus on UI frameworks, the project will be an expandable learning tool where I plan to implement various **game mechanics**
as I progress.

I'll be expanding the project step-by-step, continuously adding new features and challenges to push my development further.

### Part 1: UMG and Common UI

In the initial phase, I’m implementing a user interface using **Unreal Motion Graphics (UMG)** to familiarize myself with
Unreal's native UI framework. From there, I’ll transition to using **Common UI**, a robust plugin used in games like
*Fortnite*. Common UI is designed to support complex menu structures and advanced navigation, making it ideal for
larger-scale projects.

### Future Expansions

After establishing the UI, I'll expand the project to include **game mechanics**, creating a foundation for more
interactive features. This modular approach will allow me to continually build upon the project as I learn and develop
new skills.
